\section{Conclusion}

To conclude, for our optimization problem, the two EAs do not show a significant difference. The interesting finding that each EA performs better when being trained on a different training set sheds light on a greater complexity of a diversity vs. quality balance than we assumed. We therefore encourage future research to continue investigating the balance between diversity and quality, especially with having the effects of training and testing data sets in mind.
