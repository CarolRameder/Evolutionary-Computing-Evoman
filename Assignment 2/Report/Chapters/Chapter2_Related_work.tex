The self-adaptive mutation method was chosen due to previous research emphasizing its superiority compared to other mutation methods \cite{Teo2006SelfadaptiveMF}. Self-adaption was defined as the dynamic changes of parameters. These changes happen during the evolution, based on the inclusion of parameters within a genetic encoding that is exposed itself to evolutionary process and pressures \cite{series/ncs/EibenS03}. Moreover, the comma strategy was emphasized as a high quality survivor selection method \cite{series/ncs/EibenS03}. This is due to the ability of the comma strategy to escape local optima by discarding all parents but keeping quality by the possibility to choose the highest quality individuals for the next generation.
