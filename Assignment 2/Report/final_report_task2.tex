% \begin{abstract}
% This research paper intends to investigate the difference between an evolutionary algorithm (EA) using a self-adaptive mutation and an EA using a simple Gaussian mutation. Based on the advantages a dynamic adjustment of high or low diversity changes for individual chromosomes inherits, this research investigates whether an EA with a self-adaptive mutation can be seen as superior in comparison to an EA with a standard Gaussian mutation. To test the different methods, an agent playing the game MegaMan of the evoman framework was created. The implementation of the evolutionary algorithm was conducted in the DEAP framework. Amongst other things, this research aimed to bring insight into the differentiation of importance of \textcolor{green}{diversity} of EAs and in a context of hybridization of EAs and Neural Networks.
