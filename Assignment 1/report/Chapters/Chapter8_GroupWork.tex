\section{Group work set-up}

We split our work into two sections, 1) setting up the algorithm
and code and 2) writing the report. We set up the groundwork
for our EA together and then split the tasks for the fine-tuning.
Robin coded the multi-parent crossover and self-adaptive mutation
method, Kleio coded the line and box plots, and Carol and Matilda fine-tuned the specific parameters. For the report, we divided the
writing evenly in four parts.
