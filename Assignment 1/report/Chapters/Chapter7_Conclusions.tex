\section{Conclusion}
This research investigated the difference of fitness and gain performance between an EA with a self-adaptive mutation method and an EA with a Gaussian mutation method. Taken together, we can conclude that the self-adaptive mutation in our set-up is not superior, and in some cases even weaker than the Gaussian mutation. As discussed, this interesting finding could be based on the multi-parent crossover method and missing survival selection.\par
